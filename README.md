# Color Palettes
For many years I stored colour palettes for client brand colours and created and stored my own personal colour schemes for use in UIs and other projects on a specific website. I liked the site because of the clean, modern UI and it was very handy to quickly load the website, browse all my palettes in one place and sample the colours I needed, without having to open up an Illustrator or Photoshop file.

Recently, the site became freemium and I decided to migrate all my palettes (20+) off of the site because of that.

(I also couldn't access all the colour schemes I made, past the free trial period, without paying the subscription).

Maybe I'll update this in the future and make it a bit more featured (ability to create colour schemes in a less primitive way), but as of right now this will work through JSON files, since I just wanted a place to store and display my saved colour palettes.

Also, no hate to the dev of Coolors, but I'm like broke/cheap and I try to avoid subscriptions as much as possible. But I guess that's pretty unavoidable nowadays eh?
